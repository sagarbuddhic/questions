## GIT Topics

**Package Manager**

**yarn vs npm**

**GIT INIT**

.git subdirectory - metadata - subdirectories for objects, refs, template files. HEAD file current checked out commit.

**Remote Repos**

**git push**

## DSA

collection of values and the format they are stored in, relation between values and the operations on those values.
steps taken to solve a problem.

Algorithm           ArrayList   LinkedList

ADT        DS

List    Dynamic Array, Linked List
Queue   Linked List Based, Array Based, Stack Based
Map     TreeMap, HashMap, HashTable

DIfferent Big O:

Upper Bound of the complexity in the worst case, 
helping to quantify performance as the input size becomes arbitrarily large.

O(1) - not based on input size. constant time.
O(log n) - n/2 until we reach 1. It can also be denoted as 2<sup>n</sup>. cutting half of the items.
Example: Binary Search
O(n) - traverse all items. linear time algorithm.
O(n logn) - merge sorting, heap sorting. quasilinear runtime.
O(n<sup>2</sup>) - two dimensional array or traversing items for n array n times. quadratic runtime.cubic runtime.
O(n!) - n * (n-1) * (n -2) ....

Algorithms(set of tasks):

linear search - sequential or simple search.
binary search - cutting to half.
brute force - same as linear , exponential runtimes.
divide and conquer - merge sort.
selection sort - O (n2)
quick sort - O (n log n)

Data Structures:

Linked List - Nodes contain reference to the next node.
double linked list - contains both previous and next node reference.
Stack - One Ended linear data structure, push and pop(LIFO).
Queue - Linear Data Structure models real world queues, enqueue and dequeue(FIFO).
Priority Queue
Indexed Priority Queue
Heap - A heap is a tree based DS that satisfies the heap variant(ordered).
Union Find - DS keeps track of elements which are split into one or more disjoint sets(find and union).
Tree - Undirected graph with nodes.
       Leaf Node - without children.
Binary Tree - At most two children(greater value to the right side).
BFS -  Breadth First Search.
Hash Table - mapping from keys to values called hashing. they use functions to generate keys.
Object Data - non-scalar objects in javascript behave as associated arrays, 
so an object itself can behave as a basic hash table.
Fenwick tree - sum range queries.
Suffix Array - non empty substring at the end of a string of characters.
LCP - longest common prefix array. 
BBST - Balanaced Binary Search Tree self balancing binary search tree it will adjust itself.
Balanced Binary Tree - height of the tree is O(Log n) where n is the number of nodes.
It is a type of binary tree in which the difference between the height of the left and the right subtree for each node is either 0 or 1.
The difference between the heights of the left subtree and the right subtree for any node is known as the balance factor of the node.
AVL - Trees with rotation to make it balanced.


Efficiency:

Time Complexity
Space Complexity


## Design Principles

**SOLID**

* S - This principle states that every method/class should handle a single responsibility.
* O - open to extension, closed for modification(inheritance).
* L - Liskov - A child class should be able to do what parent does. Example - Human - child - parent.
* I - Interface segregation principle - avoid generalized interface for a class,segregated interfaces with smaller functionalities.
* D - Dependency inversion principle - Every dependency in the design should be directed toward an abstract class or interface.
      No dependency should target a concrete class.

```

**Location**

window.location.replace('https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Location.reload'); // does not save previous url in history.  
window.location.href  
window.location.assign  

// point a cursor  
const inputRange = document.createRange();  
inputRange.selectNodeContents(editDiv.current);  
inputRange.collapse(false);  
selection.removeAllRanges();  
selection.addRange(inputRange);

**spread vs rest**


**Closures:**

A closure is a function having access to the parent scope, even after the parent function has closed.

**Currying:**

Currying is translating a function from callable as f(a, b, c) into callable as f(a)(b)(c).

Example below of using closures, currying and recursive function.

```
function curry() {
    let a = 0;
    return function adder(b) {
      if(!b) {
      	return a;
      }
      a += b;
      return adder;
    };
  };

let curriedSum = curry();

alert( curriedSum(1)(2)(3)(4)() ); // 3
```

**Recursive**

In programming terms, a recursive function can be defined as a routine that calls itself directly or indirectly.

**Destructuring**

**Logical AND (&&)**

```
12 && 13 && 14 // 14
12 && 0 && false && 15 // 0
```

**Logical OR (||)**

```
12 || 13 || 15 // 12
undefined || false // false
```

**Nullish coalescing operator (??)**

```
'' ?? 'test' // ''
null ?? 'test' // 'test'
```

Amazon CloudFront

**web workers**

cannot access window, cpu intensive tasks.

**white label**

**Tricky Logic**

**Web Socket vs HTTP**

**Higher order function**

Examples: Map, Filter Function.

**In Operator**

**Callback**

Callback Hell - Hard to read & maintain callbacks.
Asynchronous operations are ALL implemented in native code (usually C/C++ code) by nodejs.

Promises

**this keyword**

 In a method, this refers to the owner object and in a function, this refers to the global object.

**Event Bubbling**

**Event Propagation**

event.stopPropagation() stops the move upwards, but on the current element all other handlers will run.
To stop the bubbling and prevent handlers on the current element from running, thereâ€™s a method event.stopImmediatePropagation(). After it no other handlers execute.

**Parse Int**

The parseInt method parses a value as a string and returns the first integer.

A radix parameter specifies the number system to use:

2 = binary, 8 = octal, 10 = decimal, 16 = hexadecimal.

```
parseInt('32', 10) // 32
```

***Math Floor***

The Math.floor() function returns the largest integer less than or equal to a given number.

```
console.log(Math.floor(5.95));
// expected output: 5

console.log(Math.floor(5.05));
// expected output: 5

console.log(Math.floor(5));
// expected output: 5

console.log(Math.floor(-5.05));
// expected output: -6
```

**Math.Ceil**

The Math.ceil() function always rounds a number up to the next largest integer.

**Math.round()**

The Math.round() function returns the value of a number rounded to the nearest integer.

console.log(Math.round(5.95), Math.round(5.5), Math.round(5.05));
// expected output: 6 6 5


**Common javascript functions**

**Map**

 **Filter**

**Reducer**

**Some**

**Every**

**Includes**

**Slice**

```
slice(start, end)

start - start index.
end - index of the value to be excluded.
```

**Splice**

```
Remove 0 (zero) elements before index 2, and insert "drum"

let myFish = ['angel', 'clown', 'mandarin', 'sturgeon']
let removed = myFish.splice(2, 0, 'drum')
```

**Shift & Unshift**

**Fill**

```
const heights2 = [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 1, 1];
heights2.fill(0, 4);
console.log(heights2); // [1, 2, 4, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```

**Reverse**

```
const reversed = array1.reverse();
console.log('reversed:', reversed);
// expected output: "reversed:" Array ["three", "two", "one"]
```

**Sort**

```
const numbers = [4, 2, 5, 1, 3];
numbers.sort(function(a, b) {
  return a - b;
});
console.log(numbers);

```

**Object.entries**

```
const object1 = {
  a: 'somestring',
  b: 42
};

for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(object1)) {
  console.log(`${key}: ${value}`);
}

// expected output:
// "a: somestring"
// "b: 42"
```

**Find**

The find() method returns the first element in the provided array that satisfies the provided testing function. If no values satisfy the testing function, undefined is returned.

```
const array1 = [5, 12, 8, 130, 44];

const found = array1.find(element => element > 10);

console.log(found);
// expected output: 12
```

**Flat**

```
const arr1 = [0, 1, 2, [3, 4]];

console.log(arr1.flat());
// expected output: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
```

**JSON Parse**

    var instance;

    function createInstance() {
        var object = new Object("I am the instance");
        return object;
    }

    return {
        getInstance: function () {
            if (!instance) {
                instance = createInstance();
            }
            return instance;
        }
    };
})();

function run() {

    var instance1 = Singleton.getInstance();
    var instance2 = Singleton.getInstance();

    console.log("Same instance? " + (instance1 === instance2));
}

src - contains js, style.js.

The /src folder comprises of the raw non-minified code.

dist: It stands for distribution and is the minified or concatenated version it has been actually used on production sites.

**minification**

Developers write code that is optimized for human readability. This code might contain extra information that is not necessary for the code to run, such as comments, spaces, indents, and multiple lines.

* bundle.js
* style.css

compression is a process in which the size of a file is reduced by re-encoding the file data to use fewer bits of storage than the original file.

**bundle**

bundle analyzer: This analysis provides a clear picture of each library used in your project and how they affect the JavaScript bundle size.
Compressing Bundles: Gzip and Brotli are the most commonly used compression techniques, and you can use their Webpack plugins to simplify the entire process.

single render with empty array in useeffect.\

Big Calculations useMemo to store the output.\  
useCallback to store the function.\  
PureComponents, React.memo for re-render only when a prop changes(Table rows).

Error Boundaries.

**Refresh Table specific row**

Create seperate component for rows. Use PureComponents or React.Memo to render only when props changes. Re-render will only happen for rows with value change.

**Nextjs Advantages**

* Webpack Integrated, Compiler replaces babel for individual files and terser for minifying output bundles.

* Pre-rendering

Server side rendering - getServerSideProps - Next.js will pre-render this page on each request.
Static Generation - getStaticProps - Next.js will pre-render this page at build time
Incremental Static Generation -  static pages, but content updates automatically without rebuilding the whole app.

* With Links, prefetches and does client side navigation.

* Automatic static optimization.

* Dynamic routing *

* Dynamic import, lazyload using suspense.

## REST Apis Topics

***Stateless***

Client provides all information required for the server in the form of url, query string, header or through a body.

***CRUD***

Create, Read, Update, Delete

POST,  GET,   PUT,    DELETE.

POST:

POST methods are used to create a new resource into the collection of resources.

PUT:

Use PUT APIs primarily to update an existing resource (if the resource does not exist, then API may decide to create a new resource or not).

PATCH:

HTTP PATCH requests are to make a partial update on a resource.

## CSS Topics

***Box Model***

In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout.
The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content. 

***Visibility vs Display vs Opacity***

* visibility: hidden - Element is still part of DOM, So the element takes up space.
* display: none - Element is removed from the DOM.
* opacity: 0 - This is used for transition mainly. Element is still part of DOM, So the element takes up space.

***display***

* contents - Makes the container disappear, making the child elements children of the element the next level up in the DOM
* inline - 	Displays an element as an inline element (like <span>). Any height and width properties will have no effect.
* block - Displays an element as a block element (like <p>). It starts on a new line, and takes up the whole width.
* flex - Displays an element as a block-level flex container
* grid - Displays an element as a block-level grid container
* inline-block	Displays an element as an inline-level block container. The element itself is formatted as an inline element, but you can apply height and width values
* inline-flex, inline-grid, inline-table.

Explanation

An element with display: flex is similar to an element with display: block, whereby it occupies the whole row. However, its child elements can be positioned flexibly and dynamically, compared to previously-available layout properties.

If we change this to display: inline-flex, it:

makes the parent container display inline
still applies all flex properties to the children, no differently form display: flex
This means that if the child elements aren't too big, two containers with display: inline-flex can sit side-by-side.
Other display properties also have an inline counterpart:

block has inline-block
table has inline-table
and even grid has inline-grid

https://codepen.io/clairecodes/pen/POjKXY

***grid vs flex***

The basic difference between CSS Grid Layout and CSS Flexbox Layout is that flexbox was designed for layout in one dimension - either a row or a column. Grid was designed for two-dimensional layout - rows, and columns at the same time.
fr - fractional unit.
grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr)

***vertical align***

baseline - baseline of parent.
percentage, pixels allowed.

**align items***

The align-items property specifies the default alignment for items inside the flexible container.

align-self - overrides align items.

The align-content property modifies the behavior of the flex-wrap property. It is similar to align-items, but instead of aligning flex items, it aligns flex lines.

text-align

justify-contents - center in flexbox.

***Descendant Selector (space)***

The descendant selector matches all elements that are descendants of a specified element. selects all paragraph below.

```
div p {
  background-color: yellow;
}

<div>
  <p>Paragraph 1 in the div.</p>
  <p>Paragraph 2 in the div.</p>
  <section><p>Paragraph 3 in the div.</p></section>
</div>
```

***Child Selector (>)***

The child selector selects all elements that are the children of a specified element.

```
div > p {
  background-color: yellow;
}

<div>
  <p>Paragraph 1 in the div.</p>
  <p>Paragraph 2 in the div.</p>
  <section>
    <!-- not Child but Descendant -->
    <p>Paragraph 3 in the div (inside a section element).</p>
  </section>
  <p>Paragraph 4 in the div.</p>
</div>
```

***Adjacent Sibling Selector (+)***

The adjacent sibling selector is used to select an element that is directly after another specific element.

```
<h2>Adjacent Sibling Selector</h2>

<p>The + selector is used to select an element that is directly after another specific element.</p>
<p>The following example selects the first p element that are placed immediately after div elements:</p>

<div>
  <p>Paragraph 1 in the div.</p>
  <p>Paragraph 2 in the div.</p>
</div>

<p>Paragraph 3. After a div.</p>
<p>Paragraph 4. After a div.</p>

<div>
  <p>Paragraph 5 in the div.</p>
  <p>Paragraph 6 in the div.</p>
</div>

<p>Paragraph 7. After a div.</p>
<p>Paragraph 8. After a div.</p>

```

***General Sibling Selector (~)***

The general sibling selector selects all elements that are next siblings of a specified element.

```
<p>Paragraph 1.</p>

<div>
  <p>Paragraph 2.</p>
</div>

<p>Paragraph 3.</p>
<code>Some code.</code>
<p>Paragraph 4.</p>
```

***pseudo***

A pseudo-class is used to define a special state of an element.

Example: Style an element when a user mouses over it.

```
a:hover {
  color: #FF00FF;
}
```

***Pseudo-element***

```
h1::after {
  content: url(smiley.gif);
}
```
***hover***

margin not considered on hover.

***css transform***

CSS transforms allow you to move, rotate, scale, and skew elements.

***position***

The five different position values are fixed, static, absolute, sticky, and relative.

* Static - The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document.
* Relative - The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document, and then offset relative to itself based on the values of top, right, bottom, and left.
* Absolute - The element is removed from the normal document flow, and no space is created for the element in the page layout.
Absolutely positioned elements are positioned with respect to a containing block, which is the nearest postioned ancestor. If there is no positioned ancestor, the viewport will be the containing block.
* Fixed - The element is removed from the normal document flow, and no space is created for the element in the page layout.
Elements with fixed positioning are fixed with respect to the viewportâ€”the viewport is always their containing block.
* Sticky - The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document, and then offset relative to its nearest scrolling ancestor and containing block (nearest block-level ancestor), including table-related elements, based on the values of top, right, bottom, and left.

***mixin***

Mixins allow document authors to define patterns of property value pairs, which can then be reused in other rulesets.

```
@mixin theme($theme: DarkGray) {
  background: $theme;
  box-shadow: 0 0 1px rgba($theme, .25);
  color: #fff;
}

.info {
  @include theme;
}
.alert {
  @include theme($theme: DarkRed);
}
.success {
  @include theme($theme: DarkGreen);
}

https://sass-lang.com/guide
```

***float***

The CSS float property specifies how an element should float.
In its simplest use, the float property can be used to wrap text around images.

The CSS clear property specifies what elements can float beside the cleared element and on which side.
When clearing floats, you should match the clear to the float: If an element is floated to the left, then you should clear to the left. Your floated element will continue to float, but the cleared element will appear below it on the web page.

***Table***

```
divWrapper {
  overflow: scroll;
}

table {
  layout: fixed
  width: 100%
}

colgroup {

}

tbody {
  
}
```

***Margin vs Padding***

 the margin property controls the space outside an element, and the padding property controls the space inside an element.

**ruleset***

**css integration***

 * style tags in the head section.
 * inline styling.
 * css in seperate file and linking to the html page.

**sprites***

 An image sprite is a collection of images put into a single image.

**css image repetition***

 The background-repeat property is used to control the image.

 ```
 background-image: url(â€˜url_of_imageâ€™);

  background-repeat: no-repeat;

  background-attachment: fixed;
 ```

**RGB***

 In CSS, a color can be specified as an RGB value, using this formula: rgb(red, green, blue) Each parameter (red, green, and blue) defines the intensity of the color between 0 and 255.

***CSS [attribute] Selector***

The [attribute] selector is used to select elements with a specified attribute.

```
a[target] {11
  background-color: yellow;
}
```

<!DOCTYPE>
<head>
<link> - best place to use it  in head tags
<script> - best place for script tags
custom tag names - inline

inline vs block

## Jenkins Topics

Jenkins is typically run as a standalone application in its own process with the built-in Java servlet container/application server (Jetty).

## Testing Topics

***Test runners***

Examples: Mocha, Jest.

***Mocha***

```
describe('Array', function () {
  describe('#indexOf()', function () {
    it('should return -1 when the value is not present', function () {
      assert.equal([1, 2, 3].indexOf(4), -1);
    });
  });
});
```

**Assertion libraries with mocha**

***should***

```
user.should.have.property('name', 'tj');
user.should.have.property('pets').with.lengthOf(4);
```

***Expect***

```
expect(window.r).to.be(undefined);
expect({ a: 'b' }).to.eql({ a: 'b' })
expect(5).to.be.a('number');
expect([]).to.be.an('array');
expect(window).not.to.be.an(Image);
```

***chai***

Chai is a BDD / TDD assertion library for node and the browser that can be delightfully paired with any javascript testing framework.

```
Should
chai.should();

foo.should.be.a('string');
foo.should.equal('bar');
foo.should.have.lengthOf(3);
tea.should.have.property('flavors')
  .with.lengthOf(3);


Expect
var expect = chai.expect;

expect(foo).to.be.a('string');
expect(foo).to.equal('bar');
expect(foo).to.have.lengthOf(3);
expect(tea).to.have.property('flavors')
  .with.lengthOf(3);


Assert
var assert = chai.assert;

assert.typeOf(foo, 'string');
assert.equal(foo, 'bar');
assert.lengthOf(foo, 3)
assert.property(tea, 'flavors');
assert.lengthOf(tea.flavors, 3);
                
```

***Mocha vs Jest***

Mocha requires other libraries to work such as sinon for stubbing.
Jest does not require any pre configuration.

***Jest***

```
test('null', () => {
  const n = null;
  expect(n).toBeNull();
  expect(n).toBeDefined();
  expect(n).not.toBeUndefined();
  expect(n).not.toBeTruthy();
  expect(n).toBeFalsy();
});

test('zero', () => {
  const z = 0;
  expect(z).not.toBeNull();
  expect(z).toBeDefined();
  expect(z).not.toBeUndefined();
  expect(z).not.toBeTruthy();
  expect(z).toBeFalsy();
});

test('two plus two', () => {
  const value = 2 + 2;
  expect(value).toBeGreaterThan(3);
  expect(value).toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(3.5);
  expect(value).toBeLessThan(5);
  expect(value).toBeLessThanOrEqual(4.5);

  // toBe and toEqual are equivalent for numbers
  expect(value).toBe(4);
  expect(value).toEqual(4);
});
```

***React Testing Library***

```
import React from 'react'
import {rest} from 'msw'
import {setupServer} from 'msw/node'
import {render, fireEvent, waitFor, screen} from '@testing-library/react'
import '@testing-library/jest-dom'
import Fetch from '../fetch'

const server = setupServer(
  rest.get('/greeting', (req, res, ctx) => {
    return res(ctx.json({greeting: 'hello there'}))
  }),
)

beforeAll(() => server.listen())
afterEach(() => server.resetHandlers())
afterAll(() => server.close())

test('loads and displays greeting', async () => {
  render(<Fetch url="/greeting" />)

  fireEvent.click(screen.getByText('Load Greeting'))

  await waitFor(() => screen.getByRole('heading'))

  expect(screen.getByRole('heading')).toHaveTextContent('hello there')
  expect(screen.getByRole('button')).toBeDisabled()
})

test('handles server error', async () => {
  server.use(
    rest.get('/greeting', (req, res, ctx) => {
      return res(ctx.status(500))
    }),
  )

  render(<Fetch url="/greeting" />)

  fireEvent.click(screen.getByText('Load Greeting'))

  await waitFor(() => screen.getByRole('alert'))

  expect(screen.getByRole('alert')).toHaveTextContent('Oops, failed to fetch!')
  expect(screen.getByRole('button')).not.toBeDisabled()
})
```

## Formatting

EditorConfig - VSCode will format according to the options in this file. If EditorConfig or prettierrc is not available then vscode will use its formatter.

ESLint - Create React App comes with ESLint and it can be extended. shows syntax errors.

Prettier - we can show as warnings and it has better formatting. https://prettier.io/docs/en/comparison.html

## Python

order of precedance
x = 10+3*2**2
print(x)
parenthesis
exponentiation
multiplication or division
addition or subtraction

elif - used for else if

for value in ['test']

none similar to null object
